SmartManager - A Comprehensive Mod for Supermarket Simulator

SmartManager is a versatile mod designed to enhance the gaming experience in Supermarket Simulator. This mod combines four main features, each developed entirely from scratch and independent of existing mods. Each feature aims to simplify the management of your supermarket while adding practical and efficient tools.

Features

ClearCart
With ClearCart, you can instantly empty the shopping cart with a dedicated button. No more deleting items one by one; this feature allows for quick and efficient order management.

Benefits:

Adds a "Clear Cart" button to the market interface.

Significant time savings when managing orders.

Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

NoMaxOrderLimit
Remove all restrictions on the number of orderable items with NoMaxOrderLimit. This feature is ideal for players who want to place massive orders without constraints.

Benefits:

Removes the maximum limit on the number of items in an order.

Compatible with all types of products available in the game.

Optimizes inventory management for large stores.

AutoBillPay
Never worry about forgotten bills again! AutoBillPay automates the payment of your bills at the start of each day, allowing you to focus on other aspects of the game.

Benefits:

Automatic bill payment at the beginning of a new day.

Integrated notifications to confirm that payments have been made.

Reduces interruptions due to unpaid bills.

NightGlow
Add an aesthetic and immersive touch to your game with NightGlow. This night lighting system activates automatically at a preset time, offering a unique ambiance during the night.

Configurable settings to adjust the time or disable lighting if needed.
